# MomentumStockRanker
Automatically ranks stocks based on their level of "momentum", as defined in the book "Stocks on the move: Beating the Market with Hedge Fund Momentum Strategies" by Andreas Clenow

Note: Not affiliated with Clenow in any way.  Plz no sue.  For real though since the strategy is basically just math, its impossible for it to be copyrighted.  If Mr. Clenow would like me to drop the association to his book, I will happily do so.
